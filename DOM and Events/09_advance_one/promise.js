// Promise Constructor: When you create a new promise, you use the Promise constructor.

// Executor Function: The Promise constructor takes a function (executor function) as an 
//argument.This function is executed immediately when the promise is created.

// Parameters of Executor: The executor function takes two parameters: resolve and reject. 
// These are functions that can be used to change the state of the promise.

// The Promise object (lowercase p, like promise1 in the example) is an instance of the Promise 
// constructor function. This object has methods like .then(), .catch(), and .finally() that you
// can use to handle the asynchronous operation.
